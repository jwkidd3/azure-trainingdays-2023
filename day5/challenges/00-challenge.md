# Challenge 0: Request an ID Token from Azure AD

## Here is what you will learn üéØ

- How to register an application in Azure AD
- How to use the OpenIDConnect protocol to authenticate users
- How to receive an __id_token__ with basic profile information of the authenticated user

Here is an high-level overview of the authentication process:
![Flow](./images/oidc-id-token-flow.png)

In short:

1. We show the user a sign-in button
2. The sign-in button forwards to the `.../oauth2/v2.0/authorize` URL, including the ID of our application and the ID of our AAD tenant
3. The user logs in and consents to letting us access his or her profile
4. Our AAD tenants forwards us to the callback URL and includes an `id_token`, which contains basic profile information of the user in form of a JWT (JSON Web Token)
5. Lastly, we could validate the returned `id_token` using its signature (not shown here, most libraries do this for us)

## Create an Azure AD Application

Before we can authenticate a user we have to register an application in our Azure AD tenant.

### Azure CLI

```shell
az ad app create --display-name challengeidtokencli --web-redirect-uris http://localhost:5001/api/tokenecho --identifier-uris https://TENANT_DOMAIN_NAME/challengeidtoken  --enable-id-token-issuance true
```

:::tip
üìù The `IdentifierUri` needs to be unique within an instance of AAD. Replace `TENANT_DOMAIN_NAME` with the domain name of your Azure AD instance.
:::

Retrieve the domain name of your current Azure AD tenant via:

```shell
az rest --method get --url 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/domains?$select=id'
```

It should be `something.onmicrosoft.com`. Make sure to paste the entire domain name for the identifier URI.

### Viewing your ApplicationId

Note down the `appId` value in the response - this is the id under which your AAD application has been registered. In the Azure Portal, we can see your new app registration under `AAD --> App Registrations --> Owned applications`:

## Run the Token Echo Server

Open another shell and run the Token Echo Server from [`day5/apps/token-echo-server`](../apps/token-echo-server) in this repository. This helper ASP.NET Core tool is used to echo the token issued by your AAD and "simulates" our website or server backend that would receive the `id_token`.

The tool is listening on port 5001 on your local machine. Tokens are accepted on the route `http://localhost:5001/api/tokenecho`. This is why we initially registered an AAD application with a reply url pointing to `http://localhost:5001/api/tokenecho`.

```shell
dotnet run
```

## Create an Authentication Request

Replace `TENANT_ID` with your AAD Tenant Id and `APPLICATION_ID` with your Application Id. Open a browser and paste the modified request.

```http
https://login.microsoftonline.com/TENANT_ID/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
client_id=APPLICATION_ID
&response_type=id_token
&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A5001%2Fapi%2Ftokenecho
&response_mode=form_post
&scope=openid%20profile
&nonce=1234
```

For explanation:

- `openid` scope allows the user to _sign in_
- `profile` scope allows us to _read_ the _basic profile information_ of the user.

Copy the `id_token` value from your browser output, go to [https://jwt.ms](https://jwt.ms) and paste the token. Take a minute and have a look at the decoded token.

## Wrap-Up

This challenge showed how to create a new application in AAD and how user can be authenticated using the Open ID Connect protocol. The full process is described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc).

## Cleanup

Remove the created resources via the Azure CLI:

```shell
az ad app delete --id <APPLICATION_ID>
```
