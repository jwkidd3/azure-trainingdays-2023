# Day 3 Data and AI

## Welcome

This day is about getting your hands dirty with data and AI in Azure. We will dig into the topics

- Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure SQL DB
- Azure Cognitive Search
- Cognitive Services

## Day 3 - Goal

Yesterday, we built a basic application that talks to services running as Azure Web Apps in the cloud. Today, we will enhance the application by introducing modern **Data Storage** services (SQL and NoSQL) and adding features of a modern user experience, like **full-text/semantic search**. We will also add further services and make sure, that they can loosely communicate with each other, so that the application itself remains easily extendable.

### Architecture

At the end of the day, we will have the following architecture up and running in Azure.

### Remarks

The challenges marked with the "ðŸ’Ž" are the ones that focus on the sample application and represent the adoption of what you have learned in the challenges before. They results of the "ðŸ’Ž" challenges will be reused in the upcoming days.

But *do not panic* in case you cannot finish them in time today: we got you covered tomorrow by a baseline deployment of today's results.

ðŸ˜Ž Enjoy your day! ðŸ˜Ž
