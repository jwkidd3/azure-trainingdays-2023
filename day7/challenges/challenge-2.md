## Prerequisites

In order to be able to store the custom Docker images you will be creating throughout this workshop, we need a _container registry_. Azure provides its own service for that, the _Azure Container Registry_.

Let's create one via the Azure CLI:

```shell
$ az group create --name adc-acr-rg --location westeurope
$ az acr create --name <ACR_NAME> --resource-group adc-acr-rg --sku basic --admin-enabled

# now let's attach the container registry to the cluster

$ az aks update --resource-group adc-aks-rg --name adc-cluster --attach-acr <ACR_NAME>
```

## Build a Custom Image

First, let's build a custom Docker image. Go to the folder `day7/challenges/samples/challenge-2/singlecontainer` and take a look at the Dockerfile.

Run the following commands to build and run the container:

```shell
docker build -t test:1.0 .
docker run -p 8080:80 test:1.0
```

Open your browser and navigate to <http://localhost:8080>. You should see a page with a welcome message.

Now let's push the image to our registry. To be able to interact with our registry, we first need to login.

```shell
ACRPWD=$(az acr credential show -n <ACR_NAME> --query "passwords[0].value" -o tsv)
docker login <ACR_NAME>.azurecr.io -u <ACR_NAME> -p $ACRPWD
```

::: tip
üìù In this sample, we used the `admin` account of our registry to login - basically with username/password.

In secure/production environments, you should not enable the `admin` account on the registry and login via Azure Active Directory: `az acr login -n <ACR_NAME>`. The token that is issued will be valid for _3 hours_.
:::

We are now ready to push the image to our container registry:

```shell
docker tag test:1.0 <ACR_NAME>.azurecr.io/test:1.0
docker push <ACR_NAME>.azurecr.io/test:1.0
```

You can also build directly _within_ the Azure Container Registry service, in case you don't have Docker on your machine. Let's try:

```shell
az acr build -r <ACR_NAME> -t <ACR_NAME>.azurecr.io/test:2.0 .
```

The command will send the current build context to Azure, kick off a docker build and add the image to your registry.

## Run your Custom Image

Now that we have an image in our container registry, let's create a _pod_. This time, we will be using a YAML manifest:

```yaml
# Content of file myfirstpod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myfirstpod
spec:
  containers:
    - image: <ACR_NAME>.azurecr.io/test:2.0
      name: myfirstpod
      resources: {}
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
  restartPolicy: Never
```

Create a file called `myfirstpod.yaml` with the content above and apply it to your cluster:

```shell
kubectl apply -f myfirstpod.yaml
```

::: tip
üìù If you could not connect your Azure Container Registry to the cluster due to missing permissions, use an [Image Pull Secret](./image-pull-secret.md) to grant your Kubernetes cluster the rights to pull images from your private registry.
:::

Check that everything works as expected:

```shell
$ kubectl get pods -w
NAME         READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
myfirstpod   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          6s
...
...
[after a few seconds]
myfirstpod   1/1     Running             0          17s
```

Also, `describe` the pod to see some more details like status, the node it is running on, events etc.:

```shell
$ kubectl describe pod myfirstpod
Name:         myfirstpod

```

## Port-Forwarding

The pod is running now, but how do we access it? Let's have a look at one option, that you typically would use in _test/debug_ scenarios.

With `kubectl` you can _port-forward_ a local port to a port on a pod. This is how it works in our case:

```shell
kubectl port-forward myfirstpod 8080:80
```

Our pod is listening on port `80` and we forward our local port `8080` to that one. You can check the result by navigating to <http://localhost:8080>.

To proof that the requests arrive at the pod, check the logs:

```shell
$ kubectl logs myfirstpod -f=true
/docker-entrypoint.sh: /docker-entrypoint.d/ is not empty, will attempt to perform configuration

```

## Running Multiple Instances of our Workload

Until now we only showed, how Kubernetes is dealing with single container/pod environments. If such a pod fails (something serious happens and the process crashes for example), Kubernetes does not take care of restarting our workload.

On top of that, we only run a single instance - ideally, we can tell Kubernetes to run multiple instances of our container in the cluster.

To give Kubernetes more control over the application/service we want to run, we need to use another object to deploy our container(s): _Deployments_.

### Deployments

In a `Deployment`, you can tell Kubernetes a few more things, that you definitely need in production environments:

- Number of instances of our container/pod
- How to do the upgrade, in case we deploy the next version of our service (e.g. always keep two instances up and running)

So let's do this. The service that we are going to deploy needs an SQL server instance to connect to. Therefore, we deploy a Microsoft SQL Server 2019 instance into our cluster that we then use from our service:

```yaml
# Content of file sqlserver.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mssql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mssql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mssql
    spec:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
      securityContext:
        fsGroup: 10001
      containers:
        - name: mssql
          image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 1433
          env:
            - name: MSSQL_PID
              value: 'Developer'
            - name: ACCEPT_EULA
              value: 'Y'
            - name: SA_PASSWORD
              value: 'Ch@ngeMe!23'
```

Create a file called `sqlserver.yaml` and apply the configuration:

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f sqlserver.yaml

deployment.apps/mssql-deployment created

$ kubectl get pods -w

NAME                                READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
mssql-deployment-5559884974-q2j4w   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          5s
mssql-deployment-5559884974-q2j4w   1/1     Running             0          39s
```

After about 30-40 seconds, you should see that the pod with the SQL Server 2019 is up and running.

Let's have a look at the deployment:

```shell
$ kubectl get deployments

NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
mssql-deployment   1/1     1            1           100s

$ kubectl describe deployment mssql-deployment

```

As we need to connect to this pod over the network, let's find out what IP address has been assigned to it:

```shell
$ kubectl get pods -o wide

NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP           NODE                                NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
mssql-deployment-5559884974-q2j4w   1/1     Running   0          4m44s   10.244.0.5   aks-nodepool1-11985439-vmss000000   <none>           <none>
```

The address may vary in your environment, for the sample here, it's `10.244.0.5`. Please note the address down, as you will need it in the next step.

Now, we can deploy an CRUD API that is able to manage `Contacts` objects i.e. that can create/read/update/delete contacts of a CRM app.

The image needs to be built upfront and put in your container registry. Go to the folder `day7/apps/dotnetcore/Scm` and build the API image:

```shell
$ docker build -t <ACR_NAME>.azurecr.io/adc-api-sql:1.0 -f ./Adc.Scm.Api/Dockerfile .

Sending build context to Docker daemon  64.51kB

 ---> b4a8315645be

```

After a successful build, push the local image to the Azure Container Registry:

```shell
$ docker push <ACR_NAME>.azurecr.io/adc-api-sql:1.0

The push refers to repository [adccontainerreg.azurecr.io/adc-api-sql]

```

There is also another approach - you can build directly within the container registry. Let's do this:

```shell
az acr build -r <ACR_NAME> -t <ACR_NAME>.azurecr.io/adc-api-sql:1.0 -f ./Adc.Scm.Api/Dockerfile .
```

Now we are ready to use the image in our deployment:

```yaml
# Content of file api.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapi
spec:
  replicas: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapi
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapi
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapi
          env:
            - name: ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnectionString
              value: Server=tcp:<IP_OF_THE_SQL_POD>,1433;Initial Catalog=scmcontactsdb;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=sa;Password=Ch@ngeMe!23;MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=False;TrustServerCertificate=True;Connection Timeout=30;
          image: <ACR_NAME>.azurecr.io/adc-api-sql:1.0
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: '128Mi'
              cpu: '500m'
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5000
```

A few notes on the deployment above:

- First and foremost, we tell Kubernetes to run _four replicas_ of our service `replicas: 4`.
- We configure the pod to set an environment variable called `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnectionString` which contains the connection string to the database (the API will use this env variable to get the connection string). Replace \<IP_OF_THE_SQL_POD\> with the correct IP address.
- We set the resource limits and expose port `5000`, so that the API can be reached from outside of the pod.

Create a file (`api.yaml`) with the contents above and apply the configuration to your cluster.
::: tip
üìù Don't forget to replace the IP address
:::

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f api.yaml

deployment.apps/myapi created
```

Let's have a look at the pods. We should now have four replicas running in the cluster:

```shell
$ kubectl get pods

NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mssql-deployment-5559884974-q2j4w   1/1     Running   0          23m
myapi-7c74475b88-7hmcj              1/1     Running   0          74s
myapi-7c74475b88-7jhtq              1/1     Running   0          74s
myapi-7c74475b88-jzmcx              1/1     Running   0          74s
myapi-7c74475b88-s5gmj              1/1     Running   0          74s
```

We are all set to test the API and the connection to the SQL server.

As before, "port-forward" a local port to a pod in the Kubernetes cluster. You can pick any of the four running API pods. In the sample here, we take pod `myapi-7c74475b88-7hmcj` - replace the pod name with one from your environment:

```shell
$ kubectl port-forward myapi-7c74475b88-7hmcj 8080:5000

Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 5000
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 5000
Handling connection for 8080
Handling connection for 8080
Handling connection for 8080
```

You can now open a browser and navigate to <http://localhost:8080>. If everything is fine, you will see the Swagger UI of the API:

![SwaggerUI](./images/swagger-api.png)

Try out the API, e.g. create a contact via the `POST` method, read (all) contacts via the `GET` operation etc.

### Failover / Health

As discussed before, Kubernetes takes care of your deployments by constantly checking the state of it and if anything is not the way it is supposed to be, Kubernetes tries to "heal" the corresponding deployment.

When a pod of a deployment gets deleted (for any reason) and the deployment - as in our case - defines to have four replicas of the service, your cluster will notice the difference and re-creates the 4th pod again to reestablish the desired state.

Let's try this. First, let's query the pods in our cluster. An this time, we are "watching" (`-w`) them so that we get notified of any changes of their states:

```shell
$ kubectl get pods -w

NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mssql-deployment-5559884974-q2j4w   1/1     Running   0          58m
myapi-7c74475b88-7hmcj              1/1     Running   0          36m
myapi-7c74475b88-7jhtq              1/1     Running   0          36m
myapi-7c74475b88-jzmcx              1/1     Running   0          36m
myapi-7c74475b88-s5gmj              1/1     Running   0          36m
```

Now open another tab/command line window and kill one of the pods. Here, we pick `myapi-7c74475b88-7jhtq` - replace the pod name with one from your environment.

```shell
$ kubectl delete pod myapi-7c74475b88-7jhtq

pod "myapi-7c74475b88-7jhtq" deleted
```

In the first tab/window where we are watching for pod changes, you should now see a similar output like:

```shell
myapi-7c74475b88-7jhtq              1/1     Terminating   0          45m

```

As you can see, Kubernetes immediately starts a new pod (`myapi-7c74475b88-rpv8x`), because for a certain amount of time, there are only three pods running/available in the cluster and in the deployment, we told Kubernetes to always have four pods present.

### Scale on purpose

In addition, you can scale a deployment on purpose to e.g. three or six replicas. Therefore, you should use the `scale` command (or edit the deployment manifest).

Kubernetes will then kill or create the corresponding amount of pods to fulfill the request. Try it out:

```shell
# Scale up to 6 replicas
$ kubectl scale deployment --replicas 6 myapi

deployment.apps/myapi scaled

# kubectl get pods should now show 6 "myapi"-pods
```

Now we learned how to scale containers/pods and how Kubernetes behaves when the desired state is different from the actual state. But still there is no way to access our pods, except via IP addresses within the cluster.

It even got worse, because we now have multiple pods running. We would need to find out all IP addresses of our pods to being able to send requests to them. This is not ideal.

So, let's introduce another object called _Service_ to have a common, load-balanced endpoint for all of our pods.

## Services

Kubernetes comes with its own service discovery component, called `Service`. A _service_ is a way to expose a set of pods as a network endpoint with a unique name.

This is very useful, because as you saw in the previous chapters, Kubernetes automatically creates and destroys pods to match the state of your cluster, IP addresses therefore change or aren't valid the next time you would call such a pod.

So, the `Service` is the one component that keeps track of what pods make up a certain service (and what IP addresses are valid to call) - and is also able to load-balance traffic across those pods.

To be able to determine which pods form a service, Kubernetes uses `Labels` and `LabelSelectors`. You assign labels to a (set of) pod(s) e.g. `app = myapi` and the corresponding service uses the same key/value combination as selector.

There are different types of services you can create in Kubernetes, let's dive into some of them.

## ClusterIP

The default service type in Kubernetes is called `ClusterIP`. If you choose that type, the service will be exposed via a cluster-internal IP address and is therefore only reachable from _within_ the cluster.

Let's see it in action. For this sample, we will be re-using the deployment and pods we created in the previous chapter (Contacts REST API and a SQL server running in the cluster).

Let's scale the API deployment back down to four replicas in case you haven't already done so:

```shell
$ kubectl scale deployment --replicas 4 myapi

deployment.apps/myapi scaled
```

After executing that command, the current state should look similar to this:

```shell
$ kubectl get pods,deployments,services

NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.0.0.1     <none>        443/TCP   5d1h
```

In the previous deployment, we already added `Labels` without really knowing what they are good for :).

Here's the excerpt of one the YAML manifests:

```yaml
spec:
  [...]
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapi
```

So, let's see, if we have these labels attached to the API pods:

```shell
kubectl get pods --show-labels -o wide

NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP            NODE                                NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES   LABELS

```

Looks good! As you can see, the SQL server pod also already has some labels (`app=mssql`).

Now, let's add two services:

- One for the SQL server (remember, we used the IP address in the connection string, which is really bad as we now know)
- One for the API pods

```yaml
# Content of file sqlserver-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mssqlsvr
spec:
  selector:
    app: mssql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 1433
      targetPort: 1433 # could be omitted, because 'port' and 'targetPort' are the same
  type: ClusterIP # could be omitted, because ClusterIP is the default type
```

```yaml
# Content of file api-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: contactsapi
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapi
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080 # 'external' port...
      targetPort: 5000 # 'internal' port...
```

Let's apply both definitions:

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f sqlserver-service.yaml
service/mssqlsvr created

$ kubectl apply -f api-service.yaml
service/contactsapi created
```

So, how do we check, that the service(s) really find pods to route traffic to? Here another Kubernetes object comes into play: `Endpoints`.

An _endpoint_ tracks the IP addresses of individual pods and is created for each service you define. The service then references an endpoint to know to which pods traffic can be routed to. Any time a pod gets created or deleted (and is part of a certain service), the corresponding `Endpoint` gets updated.

Let's see how that looks like in our case:

```shell
$ kubectl get services,endpoints

NAME                  TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/contactsapi   ClusterIP   10.0.49.134   <none>        8080/TCP   8m21s
service/kubernetes    ClusterIP   10.0.0.1      <none>        443/TCP    5d1h
service/mssqlsvr      ClusterIP   10.0.96.4     <none>        1433/TCP   8m21s

NAME                    ENDPOINTS                                                       AGE
endpoints/contactsapi   10.244.0.15:5000,10.244.0.16:5000,10.244.1.8:5000 + 1 more...   8m22s
endpoints/kubernetes    20.50.162.80:443                                                5d1h
endpoints/mssqlsvr      10.244.0.5:1433                                                 8m22s
```

This looks pretty good! The services we added have been created and also their corresponding endpoints point to the correct pod IP addresses.

In case of the `contactsapi` service/endpoint, it finds multiple pods/IP addresses to route traffic to. From now on, we could use the service name to call our pods, e.g. <http://contactsapi:8080>.

Now, there is one more step to do, before we can test the setup: adjust the connection string of the `myapi` deployment:

```yaml
[...]
    - name: ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnectionString
      value: Server=tcp:mssqlsvr,1433;Initial Catalog=scmcontactsdb;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=sa;Password=Ch@ngeMe!23;MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=False;TrustServerCertificate=True;Connection Timeout=30;
[...]
```

Replace the IP address, with the DNS name of the service `mssqlsvr` and reapply the manifest. This will result in four re-created API pods:

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f api.yaml
deployment.apps/myapi configured
```

Let's test the setup. We spin up another pod in the cluster, connect to the command line of that pod and run several calls against our API service:

```shell
$ kubectl run -it --rm --image csaocpger/httpie:1.0 http --restart Never -- /bin/sh
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
```

You are now connected to the pod and should see a command prompt. We issue some requests:

```shell

# CREATE a contact
$ echo '{ "firstname": "Satya", "lastname": "Nadella", "email": "satya@microsoft.com", "company": "Microsoft", "avatarLocation": "", "phone": "+1 32 6546 6545", "mobile": "+1 32 6546 6542", "description": "CEO of Microsoft", "street": "Street", "houseNumber": "1", "city": "Redmond", "postalCode": "123456", "country": "USA" }' | http POST http://contactsapi:8080/contacts

        "postalCode": "123456",
        "street": "Street"
    }
]
```

As you can see, the API is working perfectly _and_ the traffic is load-balanced over the four running pods of the contacts API.

In addition, the connection from an API pod to the database via the `Service` is working as expected.

## NodePort (Optional)

So far, we have learned about the default service type in Kubernetes (ClusterIP). The next one we'll cover is called `NodePort`.

A _NodePort_ service exposes the service on each worker node at a static port. You'll be able to call the service from outside the cluster, even the internet, if the node had a public IP address. By default, also a ClusterIP service, to which the NodePort service routes, is automatically created.

To demonstrate the behavior, we'll create a new service called `nodeport-contactsapi` that will select all of the API pods currently running in the cluster. Basically this is the same behavior as the ClusterIP service, but accessible via \<NodeIp>:\<NodePort>:

```yaml
# Content of file api-service-nodeport.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nodeport-contactsapi
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: myapi
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080 # 'clusterip' port...
      targetPort: 5000 # 'internal' port...
      nodePort: 30010 # optional - Kubernetes would pick a port from the default node-port range 30000-32767
```

Create a file called `api-service-nodeport.yaml` and apply the definition to your cluster:

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f api-service-nodeport.yaml

service/nodeport-contactsapi created

# Check the services/endpoints created
$ kubectl get services,endpoints
```

By using the same label selectors for the service, we get the same endpoints as for our `ClusterIP` API service.

Let's call such a service via a node's IP address and the port `30010`. First we need to determine the IP address of each node:

```shell
# get node IP adresses
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide

NAME                                STATUS   ROLES   AGE     VERSION    INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE             KERNEL-VERSION      CONTAINER-RUNTIME
aks-nodepool1-11985439-vmss000000   Ready    agent   5d20h   v1.17.11   10.240.0.4    <none>        Ubuntu 16.04.7 LTS   4.15.0-1096-azure   docker://19.3.12
aks-nodepool1-11985439-vmss000001   Ready    agent   5d20h   v1.17.11   10.240.0.5    <none>        Ubuntu 16.04.7 LTS   4.15.0-1096-azure   docker://19.3.12
aks-nodepool1-11985439-vmss000002   Ready    agent   5d20h   v1.17.11   10.240.0.6    <none>        Ubuntu 16.04.7 LTS   4.15.0-1096-azure   docker://19.3.12
```

In this case, we have the IP addresses `10.240.0.4`, `10.240.0.5` and `10.240.0.6`. Let's use one of them to call the contacts API:

```shell
$ kubectl run -it --rm --image csaocpger/httpie:1.0 http --restart Never -- /bin/sh

# inside the pod, execute...

$ http GET http://10.240.0.4:30010/contacts

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Wed, 28 Oct 2020 09:45:58 GMT
Server: Kestrel
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

[
    {
        "avatarLocation": "",
        "city": "Redmond",
        "company": "Microsoft",
        "country": "USA",
        "description": "CEO of Microsoft",
        "email": "satya@microsoft.com",
        "firstname": "Satya",
        "houseNumber": "1",
        "id": "011a9848-2889-4164-a29e-d5ffca5d58cc",
        "lastname": "Nadella",
        "mobile": "+1 32 6546 6542",
        "phone": "+1 32 6546 6545",
        "postalCode": "123456",
        "street": "Street"
    }
]
```

Perfect! We can now also call our contacts API service via a worker node.

But unfortunately, our worker nodes do not have a public IP adress. So how can we access our service now via the internet?

Let's move on to the next service type: `LoadBalancer`.

## LoadBalancer

As you might already have guessed, a service of type `LoadBalancer` is the one, that enables us to expose a service via an Azure Loadbalancer with a public IP adress.

By default, also a `ClusterIP` and `NodePort` service, to which the external load balancer routes, are automatically created.

Let's see this in action. We create an additional service that routes traffic to our four API pods, this time with a type of `LoadBalancer`:

```yaml
# Content of file api-service-loadbalancer.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: loadbalancer-contactsapi
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: myapi
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080 # 'public' port...
      targetPort: 5000 # 'internal' port...
```

Please create a file called `api-service-loadbalancer.yaml` and apply it:

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f api-service-loadbalancer.yaml

service/loadbalancer-contactsapi created

# Check available services in the cluster

$ kubectl get services -w

NAME                       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)          AGE
contactsapi                ClusterIP      10.0.49.134   <none>           8080/TCP         19h
kubernetes                 ClusterIP      10.0.0.1      <none>           443/TCP          5d21h
loadbalancer-contactsapi   LoadBalancer   10.0.163.1    <pending>        8080:30320/TCP   6s
mssqlsvr                   ClusterIP      10.0.96.4     <none>           1433/TCP         19h
nodeport-contactsapi       NodePort       10.0.87.165   <none>           8080:30010/TCP   69m
loadbalancer-contactsapi   LoadBalancer   10.0.163.1    52.236.151.220   8080:30320/TCP   56s
```

As you can see, after a short amount of time, the `loadbalancer-contactsapi` is receiving an external IP adress from the Azure Loadbalancer.

Our contacts API should now be accessible - in this case - via <http://52.236.151.220:8080>. If you open that link in a browser (of course, replace the IP adress with the one your service has received), you should see the swagger UI.

![swagger_external](./images/swagger-external.png)

We now have the tools to expose a single service to the internet via the `LoadBalancer` type. This may be okay in a scenario, where you only have few services. But to be clear, this is an _anti-pattern_.

In a production environment, you want to limit the amount of externally available services (IP adresses) to a minimum. And if your application is made of several services or is implementing a microservice-based architectural pattern, using `LoadBalancer` services is a bad practice.

Ideally, you only use one public IP adress and manage the external access to the cluster via `Ingress` definitions and the corresponding `Ingress Controller`.

## Ingress

An `Ingress` definition is a way to describe how clients are routed to your services. It manages the _external_ access to your cluster, typically via HTTP(S).

It is a core concept of Kubernetes and the _rules_ defined in an `Ingress` manifest are always implemented by a third party controller, the `Ingress Controller`. Kubernetes doesn't come with one out-of-the-box, but you can install one from a variety of offerings.

We will be using the _NGINX_ Ingress Controller, but here's an awesome comparion of all the (relevant) available options: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/191WWNpjJ2za6-nbG4ZoUMXMpUK8KlCIosvQB0f-oq3k/htmlview#>

The `Ingress Controller` sits in front of many services within a cluster and is the (most of the time) the only service of type `LoadBalancer` with a public IP in Kubernetes, routing traffic to your services and - depending on the implementation - can also add functionality like SSL termination, path rewrites, name based virtual hosts, IP whitelisting etc.

![ingress controller](./images/ingress_controller.png)

### Installation

To install the [NGINX ingress controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/), we will be using _Helm_. Helm is the de facto package manager in the Kubernetes ecosystem.

If you haven't installed it already, please go to <https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/> and follow the instructions depending on the OS you are using. If you follow this workshop in the Azure Cloud Shell, you are good to go - it is already installed for you.

::: tip
üìù To keeps things cleary seperated from each other, we will be using a different namespace for the ingress controller. [Kubernetes namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) are a way to logically group workloads within a cluster - they literally create a "virtual cluster" in your physical cluster.

By the way, you are already using namespaces! Every time you were deploying pods, services etc. to the cluster, you were using the `default` namespace which has been created for you during cluster creation. You can list the available namespaces by executing `kubectl get namespaces`.
:::

Let's install the ingress controller:

NAME: my-ingress
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Oct 29 08:11:35 2020
NAMESPACE: ingress
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
The ingress-nginx controller has been installed.
It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
You can watch the status by running 'kubectl --namespace ingress get services -o wide -w my-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller'
[...]
[...]
```

After the controller has been installed, check the correspondig service:

```shell

$ kubectl --namespace ingress get services my-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller

NAME                                  TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                      AGE
my-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller   LoadBalancer   10.0.200.226   20.67.122.249   80:32258/TCP,443:31950/TCP   2m37s
```

The service `my-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller` successfully got a public IP and is now ready to accept traffic.

But using an IP adress to navigate to websites/services is not the best option, correct? Let's use a fully-qualified-domain-name (FQND). The problem is, we haven't registered a domain for our sample.

But: you can use a service called [nip.io](https://nip.io/) that will give you "dynamic routing" by simply adding the IP adress (with dots "." or dashes "-" as seperator) as a subdomain of the domain "nip.io". In the current case, the domain looks like this: <http://20-67-122-249.nip.io/>

You can test the setup, by opening a browser and navigating to that URL...you should see a page similar to that one.

The IP adress of the ingress controller will be the _only one_ exposed in our cluster now.

Therefore, we can get rid of the one created in the previuos chapter. To have a clean environment, let's also remove the `NodePort` service:

```shell
# this one will take some time, because Kubernetes needs to delete the public IP at the Azure Loadbalancer
$ kubectl delete service loadbalancer-contactsapi

service "loadbalancer-contactsapi" deleted

$ kubectl delete service nodeport-contactsapi

service "nodeport-contactsapi" deleted

# query the service - you should have the 'mssqlsvr' and 'contactsapi' service (ClusterIP)
$ kubectl get services

NAME          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
contactsapi   ClusterIP   10.0.49.134   <none>        8080/TCP   40h
kubernetes    ClusterIP   10.0.0.1      <none>        443/TCP    6d17h
mssqlsvr      ClusterIP   10.0.96.4     <none>        1433/TCP   40h
```

Let's create an ingress definition for the Contacts API.

## Create Ingress Definitions

The controller has been successfully installed and can accept traffic. We are ready to create an [ingress definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) for the Contacts API.

To access the service, we want to be able to call an endpoint like that: <http://20-67-122-249.nip.io/api/contacts>. Therefore, we will be using path-based routing:

```yaml
# Content of file api-ingress.yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ing-contacts
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors: 'true'
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-headers: 'Keep-Alive,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type,Authorization,Accept-Language'
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-max-age: '600'
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: '12m'
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: '/contacts/$2'
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: 'true'
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
    - host: 20-67-122-249.nip.io # this should be replaced with YOUR OWN DOMAIN
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /api/contacts(\/|$)(.*)
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: contactsapi
                port:
                  number: 8080
```

Create the file `api-ingress.yaml` and apply it:

```shell
kubectl apply -f api-ingress.yaml
```

You should now be able to navigate to the adress <http://20-67-122-249.nip.io/api/contacts> and get the list of available contacts.

Traffic is managed by the ingress controller and dynamically routed to the `contactsapi` service (that is by default not accessible publicly - only now through the ingress controller/definition).

![ingress_contacts](./images/ingress_contacts.png)

As you can see in the ingress definition, we also added a few annotations to influence how the underlying NGINX server is dealing with requests:

- We enabled [Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (`nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors`).
- We defined which headers are allowed (`nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-headers`).
- We defined how long the CORS response is valid until the next CORS request will be sent by the browser (`nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-max-age`).

::: tip
üìù There is a long list of available annotations you can use with the NGINX ingress controller: <https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/>.

Of course, other ingress controllers support similar definitions.

## Add the UI

Just having an API is pretty boring. Of course there is also a UI service, that is able to interact with the API. Let's also add that component to our cluster to have a "real-life setup".

Go to the folder `day7/apps/frontend/scmfe/public/settings` and adjust the `settings.js` file for the frontend. We need to tell the Single Page Application, where to access the Contacts API:

```js
var uisettings = {
  endpoint: 'http://<YOUR_NIP_DOMAIN>/api/contacts/',
  enableStats: false,
  aiKey: '',
};
```

In the current sample, the file looks like this:

```js
var uisettings = {
  endpoint: 'http://20-67-122-249.nip.io/api/contacts/',
  enableStats: false,
  aiKey: '',
};
```

Save the file and go to the folder `day7/apps/frontend/scmfe` and build/publish the Docker image:

- Alternative 1: Build locally

  ```shell
  docker build -t <ACR_NAME>.azurecr.io/adc-frontend-ui:1.0 .
  docker push <ACR_NAME>.azurecr.io/adc-frontend-ui:1.0
  ```

- Alternative 2: Use your Azure Container Registry

  ```shell
  az acr build -r <ACR_NAME> -t <ACR_NAME>.azurecr.io/adc-frontend-ui:1.0 .
  ```

As soon as the image is present in your registry, deploy it to the cluster.

We need three definitions: a deployment, a `ClusterIP` service and an ingress object. This time, we will deploy everything via one file, separating each object by `---`.

Don't forget to **adjust the the ingress host** to the domain you are using:

```yaml
# Content of file frontend.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myfrontend
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myfrontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myfrontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myfrontend
          image: <ACR_NAME>.azurecr.io/adc-frontend-ui:1.0
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: '128Mi'
              cpu: '500m'
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend
  labels:
    app: myfrontend
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: myfrontend
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 80
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ing-frontend
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors: 'true'
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-headers: 'Keep-Alive,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type,Authorization,Accept-Language'
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-max-age: '600'
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: '12m'
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
    - host: 20-67-122-249.nip.io # this should be replaced with YOUR OWN DOMAIN
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: frontend
                port:
                  number: 8080
```

Create a file called `frontend.yaml` with the content above and apply it:

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f frontend.yaml

deployment.apps/myfrontend created
service/frontend created
ingress.networking.k8s.io/ing-frontend created
```

Please check, that everything is in place:

```shell
$ kubectl get deployment,service,endpoints,ingress

That looks good! Open a browser and navigate to the website (here: <http://20-67-122-249.nip.io/>), open the contacts list and create/modify a contact.

## Wrap-Up

üéâ **_Congratulations_** üéâ

You have deployed a full-blown application to Kubernetes with a SQL server running inside the cluster.

As you might guess, there are a few things now that need to be adjusted:

- We added some of the configuration settings - even worse, passwords! - "hard-coded" to manifest files.
- The endpoint configuration for the UI has been baked into the image.

In the next challenge, we will adress these issues.
