npm -l            display full usage info
npm help <term>   search for help on <term>
npm help npm      involved overview
```

## Vue CLI

![vuejs](./images/vuejs.png 'vuejs')

We will be using VueJS as our frontend framework. Install it from the command-line via npm:

```shell
$ npm install -g @vue/cli@4.5.15

[...]
[...]
[...]

$ vue --version

@vue/cli 4.5.15
```

## Azure CLI

We will also be using the Azure command-line interface to create and interact with resources running in Azure. To install it, go to <https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest> and choose your platform.

When finished, login to your Azure account from the command-line:

```shell
$ az login
You have logged in. Now let us find all the subscriptions to which you have access...
```

A browser window will open, login to Azure and go back to the command prompt. Your active subscription will be shown as JSON, e.g.:

```json
{
  "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
  "id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "isDefault": false,
  "name": "Your Subscription Name",
  "state": "Enabled",
  "tenantId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "user": {
    "name": "xxx@example.com",
    "type": "user"
  }
}
```

:::tip
üìùIf you have multiple subscriptions, make sure you are working with the correct one!
:::

```shell
$ az account show
{
  "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
  "id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "isDefault": false,
  "name": "Your Subscription Name",
  "state": "Enabled",
  "tenantId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "user": {
    "name": "xxx@example.com",
    "type": "user"
  }
}
```

If the displayed subscription is not the correct one, follow the steps below:

```shell
$ az account list -o table
[the list of available subscriptions is printed]

$ az account set -s <SUBSCRIPTIONID_YOU_WANT_TO_USE>
```

## Visual Studio Code

To work with all the samples provided in this workshop, you will need an IDE. To target a wide range of developers/architects, we will be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as it works cross-platform. Therefore, go to <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview> and install it on your machine.

:::warning
Please do not use VSCodium. You will run into problems building/debugging some of the samples provided in this workshop.
:::

### Useful Extensions

After the setup is complete, open Visual Studio Code and select the "Extensions" sidebar:

![Visual Studio Extensions](./images/vscode_extensions.png 'VS Code Extensions')

Search and install the following extensions:

- Azure Tools <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack>
- C# <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp>
- Azure Functions <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions>

:::tip
üìù The _Azure Functions_ extension should have already been installed as part of the _Azure Tools_ extension, but you additionally need to make sure to follow the OS-specific instructions.
:::

## Azure Storage Explorer

In order to work with Azure Storage Accounts, we will use the Azure Storage Explorer. Go to <https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/>, download and install the tool.

## Azure Data Studio

We will also work with Azure SQL Databases. You can, of course, use SQL Server Management Studio if you are on a Windows machine. If you want to work cross-platform, use Azure Data Studio.

Go to <https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio>, download and install the tool.

![Azure Data Studio](./images/azure_data_studio.png 'Azure Data Studio')

## jq

jq is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. In some challenges we use jq to process the JSON documents that we get back from Azure CLI. To install jq go to <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/> and follow the instructions.

![jq](./images/jq.png)

## git Version Control

The repository is located at [GitHub](https://github.com/), so - obviously - we will need a local git client to interact with the repository. Download and install the appropriate version of git here: <https://git-scm.com/download>
