Copy the script to the folder with your **\*.png** images and run it. It will add a nice shadow effect to all of them.

You need to create a folder called `converted` upfront in your images folder.

**IMPORTANT**: you should use the script not for partial screenshots of windows as this would add too much noise when reading challenges. Use the script when you have a screenshot, where the window frame is visible.
