## Import the Azure Developer College's repository into your organization

In the last challenges we have learned a lot about GitHub features and Azure
bicep. Now it's time to come back to the Azure Developer College's sample
application and connect the dots. In the next challenges and breakout sessions
we want to show you how to use a CI/CD workflow to deploy the sample application
to Azure using GitHub Actions workflows. All Azure bicep and GitHub Actions
workflows are already available in the Azure Developer College's repository.
Don't worry you don't have to implement all parts to create a professional CI/CD
workflow. We just need to import the repository into your GitHub organization.

So, let's get started!

Navigate to your GitHub organization and go to the section _Repositories_ and
create a new repository. In the _New repository_ form click the _Import a
repository_ link.

In the _Import your project to GitHub_ view, we need to specify the URL of the
repository we want to import. Use the URL of the Azure Developer College
traningdays repository
[https://github.com/azuredevcollege/trainingdays](https://github.com/azuredevcollege/trainingdays).
Use the name `trainingdays` as repository name.

::: danger

üõë Be careful and use the right owner for the repository you want to import!

:::

We need to make the repository public, as we want to set _Branch rules_ later in
this challenge. Branch rules are only available for public repositories on the
free tier. After all values are set, we can start the import.

It may take some time (several minutes) until the repository is imported.

After the import was successful, we can get started and take a look at the
repository. Don't worry if there are still some branches that not yet merged
into the master. When importing a repository, all branches are imported. The
college is continuously being developed in branches, but we can ignore these for
now.

::: tip

üìù You can also clone the original repository, change the url of the _origin_ remote, and push into a new empty repository.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:azuredevcollege/trainingdays.git
cd trainingdays
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<your_org>/trainingdays.git
git push
```

## Set branch rules

With branch rules you can protect your branches and enforce certain workflows,
such as requiring an approving review or passing status checks for all pull
requests.

We want to establish the following workflow for all our pull requests before
changes can be merged into the master branch:

- A pull request needs at minimum one approving review
- All status checks must pass

To set a branch rule for the master branch, navigate to the imported
`trainingdays` repository and go to the _Settings_ section. On the left
navigation bar choose _Branches_. Under _Branch protection rules_ we can add a
new protection rule.

In the view _Branch protection rule_ we use `master` as _Branch name pattern_ as
we want to apply the rule to the master branch only. Now we specify in _Protect
matching branches_ which rules we want to apply.

- Set _Require pull request review before merging_ and require one approving reviewer
- Set _Require status checks to pass before merging_

:::tip

üìù If you want to enforce all configured restrictions even for administrators.
Set _Include administrators_.

Take your time and have a look at the other protection rules. You can find more
about them in the GitHub Documentation
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches).

## Manage access

At the moment you, as the repository's owner, are the only one who can
contribute to the repository and manage issues and pull requests. As we have
applied branch rules, we need to give access to other people to allow them to
manage issues and pull requests. We have already seen how to manage access and
grant write permissions to a repository in
[00-challenge-org](./00-challenge-org.md#create-a-team-and-assign-permission).

Now, grant write permissions to the _AzDC-Team_ we created in
[00-challenge-org](./00-challenge-org.md).

## Summary

With branch protection rules we can protect branches and enforce certain
workflows. In our case we have applied rules which enforce the following
workflow:

- whenever we want to make changes in the master branch, we have to create a new
  branch from the master first, as a direct push to the master branch is prevented
- once the work in the new branch is completed, we have to integrate it into the
  master branch via a pull request
- the pull request must be verified by at least one reviewer
- status checks must pass (we will create them in the next challenge)

In the next challenge we will see how we can request reviewers to approve a pull
request and how we can add GitHub Actions workflows as status checks.
